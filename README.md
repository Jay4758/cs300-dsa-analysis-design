## Reflection

For this class, we worked on two main projects that focused on using different data structures to solve problems. In Project One, I looked at how different structures like vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees (BSTs) work when it comes to speed and memory. In Project Two, I wrote a working program that loads course data from a file and prints a list of courses in alphabetical order.

The main problem I was solving was figuring out the best way to organize and search through a list of college courses. Data structures are important because they decide how fast and efficient a program runs. For example, a vector is easy to use but slow when searching. A hash table is super fast for searching, but it doesn’t keep things in order. A binary search tree is a good balance because it keeps things sorted and is still fast, especially when the tree is balanced.

At first, I had trouble with writing the code to insert courses into the binary search tree the right way and making sure the file loaded correctly. Some lines in the file were missing information, so I had to add extra checks to skip bad data. I fixed most of the bugs by printing things out step by step and testing with different files until everything worked.

Doing this project helped me become a better programmer. I started thinking more about how my code is written—not just making it work, but making it easier to read, fix, or improve later. I also learned how to pick the right data structure for a task instead of just guessing or using whatever is easiest.

Now I understand how big of a difference data structures make, and I feel more confident writing programs that are clean, organized, and ready for the real world.
